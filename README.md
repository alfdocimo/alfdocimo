Well, hello there! 👋

Welcome to my github profile. This is where I upload all my ~~bugs and lame attempts at programming~~ projects and other cool things. Feel free to take a look around! 😊

I'm constantly trying to expand my knowledge about new frameworks and ways to do things. Traveling and exploring new cultures and places is one of my favorite things to do. I'm very passionate about music, web design and video editing. I like working in areas in which I have to learn and continuously expand my knowledge and adapt quickly to new situations.

## Projects

### Kudos as a service

Pretty self explanatory - send kudos to your friends, colleagues and loved ones!

### WP5 + single-spa micro-front-end

Each package is deployed as an individual module on a CDN a then consumed on the core app

https://schwifty-search.surge.sh/dist/index.html
https://schwifty-viewer.surge.sh/dist/index.html
https://schwifty-shell.surge.sh/dist/index.html

This is currently a monorepo, but the idea is that each package can be separated into its own repo and consumed from a CDN through the core module. It uses Yarn Workspaces to boot up all modules for local development.
